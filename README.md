# Eats-n-such

## - This is a group based project made with Kyle Condie, Macheya Steele, and Jason Adams.

## - We created a location based searching application that uses OpenBreweryDB, Zomato, and OpenCageData  APIs to generate a list of restaurants, breweries, or both in your area.

**The Process:**

- We created an idea for a design.

- We created the basic starting functions to get location then do API searches based off of the location that was given.

- We created a skeleton HTML document to get styling started.

- We styled the page using the Materialize library.

- We created functions to generate new lists based on the results returned from the fetch requests, then added them to the page.

**Example of successful search:**
