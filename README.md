# Eats-n-such

## This is a group based project made with Kyle Condie, Macheya Steele, and Jason Adams.

## We created a location based searching application that uses OpenBreweryDB, Zomato, and OpenCageData  APIs to generate a list of restaurants, breweries, or both in your area.

**The Process**

- We created an idea for a design 

- We created the basic starting functions to get location then do API searched based off of the location that was given

- We created a skeleton HTML document to get styling started

- We styled the page using the Materalize library
