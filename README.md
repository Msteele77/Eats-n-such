# Eats-n-such

## This is a group based project created by Kyle Condie, Macheya Steele, and Jason Adams.

-This application allows the user to search based off their current location, or by entering a chosen location, and gives the option to see breweries, restaurants or both in the area chosen. The last five searched cities will appear below the search bar.

**The Process:**

- A mockup and user story was created to showcase our desired functionality, purpose and design. The remote repository, initial starting files and the HTML skeleton were created to get the project started. 

- The basic starting functions were created to get user location and an API search based off of the location that was given to provide restaurants and/or breweries. 

- We then styled using CSS and Materialize library, and ensured the application was mobile responsive. 

## Technologies Used
- Languages/Frameworks: HTML, CSS, Materialize, JS
- APIs: OpenBreweryDB, Zomato and OpenCageData
